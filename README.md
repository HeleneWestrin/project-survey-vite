# Survey Project

The project involved building a React survey with at least three questions, using different input types (radio buttons, dropdown). Upon submission, users are shown a summary of their answers. The focus was on practicing React state and controlled forms while ensuring accessibility, responsiveness, and clean code.

Collaboration was done via GitHub and we worked on separate branches and to then merge the changes to main.

### The Process

We started out setting up the structure of the project together using LiveShare. When that was done we had a semi-working flow with state manangement. We could then divide the tasks between us. We set up a Canvas in Slack with to-dos and assigned ourselves to various tasks throughout the week.
