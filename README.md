# Survey Project

The project involved building a React survey with at least three questions, using different input types (radio buttons, dropdown). Upon submission, users are shown a summary of their answers. The focus was on practicing React state and controlled forms while ensuring accessibility, responsiveness, and clean code.

Collaboration was done via GitHub and we worked on separate branches and then merged the changes to main.

### The Process

Prior to our first meeting, Helene set up the design on Figma and also created a flowchart to help us visualize the data flow and state management for our application.

We started with setting up the structure of the project by pair programming using LiveShare and a Slack huddle. When that was done, we had a semi-working flow with state manangement. We could then divide the tasks between us. 

One challenge was that our schedules rarely aligned, so after our first meeting we had to find a way to make progress in our own time while avoiding merge conflicts. We set up a Canvas in Slack with an organized to-do list and assigned ourselves various tasks throughout the week. We  also included detailed comments in our code and this helped to promote clarity and communication.
